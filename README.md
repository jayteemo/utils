# nRF Cloud Utilities

This repository contains scripts that support certain use cases of nRF Cloud, mainly endpoints in [the REST API](https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1).

The scripts are gathered from various teams and organized according to their programmatic language: [Python](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/master/python/modem-firmware-1.3%2B) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/master/node-ts). We cannot, at this time, offer the same scripts across all languages.

Please see the README in each folder for more information pertaining to each language.

See also the official nRF Cloud documentation on [Device Security](https://docs.nrfcloud.com/Devices/DeviceSecurity/Security), as well as the [Getting Started with Your Devices guide](https://docs.nrfcloud.com/GettingStarted/).
